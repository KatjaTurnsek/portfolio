      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        To create a bold, dark-first identity for Heart Asylum, a European alternative rock duo
        built for real world use across
        <strong>cover art, streaming platforms and social media</strong>. The logo needed a strong
        silhouette that stays recognizable at small sizes while also working as a complete lockup
        for posters and artwork.
      </p><p>Alongside the logo suite, I designed a single cover with an intentionally
        <strong>atmospheric hierarchy</strong>
        where the simple line-art illustration leads and the typography supports the mood.
      </p>

            <h3>Concept &amp; Creation</h3>
            <ul class='bullet-list'>
              <li>
                Designed an emblem style mark centered on a
                <strong>heart motif</strong>
                with sharp, architectural details aimed to feel iconic, dramatic, and
                genre-appropriate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Built a usable logo system with
                <strong>primary/secondary lockups</strong>, icon, and text-only variations, ready
                for both small UI placements and large format artwork.
              </li>
              <li>
                Created a consistent visual language for the single cover high contrast linework
                over a dark portrait, keeping the identity cohesive across branding and artwork.
              </li>

              Single cover - “Used to Believe in Angels.” Low contrast typography was intentional to
              keep focus on the wing illustration and atmosphere.

            <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
            <p>
              I approached the identity like a system: the emblem needed to be recognizable as an
              <strong>icon</strong>, but also strong enough to carry a full lockup on posters and
              artwork.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the cover, I intentionally pushed a
              <strong>moody hierarchy</strong>, the wings are the visual hook, the portrait supports
              the tone, and the typography sits back to preserve the cinematic feel.
            </p><p>The result balances clarity with atmosphere, while keeping the band’s visual
              identity consistent across branding and release graphics.

      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
      <p>
        This project connected branding and artwork into one cohesive release package: a logo suite
        that’s flexible across formats, and cover art that uses contrast and restraint to build
        mood. The identity is designed to work where bands actually live - avatars, streaming,
        posters, and social without losing recognizability or tone.
